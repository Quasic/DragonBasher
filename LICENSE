# Most of the buildings are from Reiner's Tileset.
# Reiner has a variety of 2d and 3d artwork available
# and is awesome.

# Other graphics, such as the ground tiles and
# characters, were drawn by me (Joe again). I use
# Photofiltre mostly, as it has a smaller "footprint"
# than programs like Gimp and has an old-school
# PSP (that's Paint Shop Pro) feel to it.

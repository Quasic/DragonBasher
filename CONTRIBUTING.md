If it's not broke, don't fix it. Other than that, get 'r done. :)

One thing about Perl and me is that I do not use the "strict" variable settings and what not, so any variable you assign would be accessible by any subroutine. In Perl circles, this is frowned upon but I prefer it as it resembles the old-school BASIC I prefer, and it is faster and more effective than assigning the same variable multiple times for multiple routines. Set it once, and let every routine access it.

The other thing to keep in mind is that I don't like using Perl "modules", while these make things quick and easy for the programmer, they also add server load ... plus, they don't work with scaled down versions of Linux such as DSL (Damn Small Linux) ... DSL was used on the Fordana server and it is not out of the question that I may want to setup another such home server for 'dragon'.

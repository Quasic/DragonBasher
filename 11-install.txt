Step 1: unzip the '11-dragon' directory as a sub-directory of your cgi-bin
            directory.

Step 2: CHMOD the files "11-dragon.cgi" and "11-sysop.cgi" to give them
            execute permissions. 

Step 3: Unzip the "11-gfx.zip" file into your public_html folder

Step 4: edit config settings in the file "11-config.pl". The $datadir should
            be below your public_html directory; if it does not exist, the script
            will attempt to create it and CHMOD it to 777 for write access.  

Step 5: load the 11-sysop.cgi script into your web browser to install a demo
            server. After the install, click the "login" link to login to your server.
            You can install as many servers as your hardware allows by running
            the 11-sysop.cgi script again and giving the new server a unique name.
